speechd-el 0.1 released
=======================

The Free(b)soft project is pleased to announce speechd-el 0.1.

* What is speechd-el?

  speechd-el is an Emacs client to Speech Dispatcher, providing a
  complex speech interface to Emacs, focused especially on (but not
  limited to) the blind and visually impaired users.  It allows the user
  to work with Emacs without looking on the screen, using the speech
  output produced by the synthesizers supported in Speech Dispatcher.

  Key speechd-el features are:
  
  - Automated speaking of most Emacs messages and actions, without
    necessity to customize each particular Emacs function to make it
    speak.

  - Most built-in and external Emacs packages can produce speech output
    immediately, without any special support.
    
  - Almost no change of the standard Emacs behavior, no interference
    with user settings.
  
  - Highly configurable.

  - Full cooperation with Speech Dispatcher.

  - Small code size.

  - Free software, distributed under the GPL.

  Part of the speechd-el package is an Elisp library for communication
  with Speech Dispatcher, allowing you to write your own Emacs speech
  output extensions and your own Emacs interfaces to Speech Dispatcher.
