speechd-el 2.1 released
=======================

The Free(b)soft project is pleased to announce speechd-el 2.1.

* What is speechd-el?

  speechd-el is an Emacs client to Speech Dispatcher and BrlTTY (and
  possibly other alternative output devices), providing a complex speech
  and Braille interface to Emacs, focused especially on (but not limited
  to) the blind and visually impaired users.  It allows the user to work
  with Emacs without looking on the screen, listening to speech output
  produced by the speech synthesizers supported in Speech Dispatcher and
  watching Braille output on Braille displays supported by BrlTTY.

  Key speechd-el features are:

  - Speech output and Braille input/output.
  
  - Automated "intelligent" and reading of most Emacs messages and
    actions.  Additional commands for explicit reading.

  - Message priorities, voice parameter changes, sound icons and other
    features provided by Speech Dispatcher.

  - Multilingual support.
    
  - Almost no change of the standard Emacs behavior, no interference
    with user settings.
  
  - Highly configurable.

  - Mechanism for adding backends for other alternative output devices.

  - Programming libraries for both the user interface and generic
    speech, Braille and other output.

  - Small code size.

  - Free Software, distributed under the GPL.

  More information about speechd-el (including comparison with
  Emacspeak) can be found on its web page, see

* What is new in the 2.1 version?

  This is primarily a bug fix release.  The only new features are:

  - Invisible text is no longer read.

  - Support for BrlTTY 3.8 and its 64-bit key codes added.

  - WINDOWPATH BrlTTY environment variable (renamed from WINDOWSPATH) is
    recognized.
