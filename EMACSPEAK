What are the differences between speechd-el and Emacspeak?

Generally, speechd-el and Emacspeak are independent and differently designed
tools serving a similar purpose.  We expect them to be used by different groups
of users with different needs.

The main principal difference between speechd-el and Emacspeak is that
speechd-el intends to be simple in all aspects and relying on the Speech
Dispatcher services, while Emacspeak tries to be complex and handling
everything.

Particular reasons why you might want to use speechd-el:

- You want to use Braille output in a similar way to using speech output.
  Emacspeak currently doesn't support Braille output at all.

- You want to use Speech Dispatcher.  Emacspeak currently doesn't support it
  and it is unlikely it will provide more than a limited support in future, due
  to Emacspeak architecture.

- You are accustomed to the standard Emacs environment and you like systems
  that don't changed it more than absolutely necessary.

- You prefer making user customizations yourself, maybe using provided
  customization tools, over having everything pre-customized, possibly in ways
  you don't like.

- You want to hack or customize the Emacs speech system itself and you prefer
  small and clean programs for that purpose.

Particular reasons why you might want to use Emacspeak:

- You already use Emacspeak and you are happy with it.

- You don't want to use Speech Dispatcher.

- You want to get everything pre-customized and standard Emacs behavior changed
  in an attempt to provide a special environment to visually impaired users.
