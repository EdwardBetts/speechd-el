This is an Emacs client to Speech Daemon.

It consists of two parts:

- The library file speechd.el implementing access functions to the Speech
  Daemon protocol.

- The files speechd-emacspeak.el and dtk-interp.el to access Speech Daemon from
  Emacspeak.

Prerequisites:

- The Elib Elisp library is required (available in Debian as `elib').

If you want to use Emacspeak with Speech Daemon, you must perform the following
installation steps:

- Copy all the *.el files to your Emacspeak lisp source directory.  The file
  dtk-interp.el here replaces the original Emacspeak dtk-interp.el file.

- Apply the patch `emacspeak.patch' in the emacspeak/lisp/ directory.

- Recompile Emacspeak (this step is necessary!).

- Byte compile the files speechd.el and speechd-emacspeak.el, e.g.:

  $ rm *.elc
  $ emacs -q -no-site-file -batch -l speechd.el -f batch-byte-compile speechd*.el

- Copy the compiled *.elc files to your Emacspeak compiled lisp files
  directory.

(On Debian systems, you can use the script `install-debian.sh'.)

Then start `speechd' and run Emacs as

  $ emacs -l YOUR-EMACSPEAK-SOURCE-DIRECTORY/speechd-emacspeak.el

It should start Emacspeak connected to Speech Daemon.

This interface has been tested with Emacspeak 17.

You can send your bug reports, patches, suggestions, etc. to the mailing list
speechd-devel@freebsoft.org.
