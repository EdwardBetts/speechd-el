speechd-el is an Emacs client to speech synthesizers, Braille displays and
other alternative output interfaces.  It provides full speech and Braille
output environment for Emacs.

It consists of two parts:

- User interface that makes Emacs speak or communicate through a Braille
  display during its common operation.  This makes Emacs accessible to visually
  impaired users.  The user interface part is implemented in the
  speechd-speak.el file.

- Backends, namely SSIP (Speech Dispatcher) and BrlTTY access libraries.  They
  are used by the frontend and can be used to communicate 

Installation:

- Install the `eieio' Elisp library, available from
  http://cedet.sourceforge.net/eieio.shtml or perhaps your favorite operating
  system distribution.

- Copy the *.el files somewhere to your Emacs load path.

- If you like, byte compile them.

- Install the `speechd-log-extractor' script somewhere to your shell PATH
  (optionally, used only for bug reporting).

- Start Speech Dispatcher and/or BrlTTY.

- Start Emacs and apply the commands

    M-x load-library RET speechd-speak RET

    M-x speechd-speak RET

  In case you want speech output, do:

    M-x load-library RET speechd-ssip RET

  In case you want Braille output, do:

    M-x load-library RET speechd-brltty RET

Now, your Emacs should speak and/or output to your Braille display.

See the Texinfo manual for complete documentation.

You can send your bug reports, patches, suggestions, etc. to the mailing list
