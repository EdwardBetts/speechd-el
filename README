speechd-el is an Emacs client to speech synthesizers, Braille displays and
other alternative output interfaces. It provides full speech and Braille output
environment for Emacs.

It is aimed primarily at visually impaired users who need non-visual
communication with Emacs, but it can be used by anybody who needs sophisticated
speech or other kind of alternative output from Emacs.  speechd-el can make
Emacs a completely speech and BrlTTY enabled application suitable for visually
impaired users or, depending on its configuration, it can only speak in certain
situations or when asked, to serve needs of any Emacs user.

For more information about speechd-el features see the Texinfo manual or the
project web page http://www.freebsoft.org/speechd-el (you can also find some
comparison with Emacspeak there).

Installation:

- Install the `eieio' Elisp library, available from
  http://cedet.sourceforge.net/eieio.shtml or perhaps from your favorite
  operating system distribution.

- Copy the speechd-el *.el files somewhere to your Emacs load path.

- If you like, byte compile them.

- Install the `speechd-log-extractor' script somewhere to your shell PATH (this
  step is optional, the script is used only for bug reporting).

- Start Speech Dispatcher and/or BrlTTY.

- Start Emacs and call the commands

    M-x load-library RET speechd-speak RET

    M-x speechd-speak RET

  In case you want speech output, do:

    M-x load-library RET speechd-ssip RET

  In case you want Braille output, do:

    M-x load-library RET speechd-brltty RET

Now, your Emacs should speak and/or output to your Braille display.

See the Texinfo manual for complete documentation.

You can send bug reports, patches, suggestions, etc. to the mailing list
speechd@lists.freebsoft.org.
