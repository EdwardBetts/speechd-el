This is an Emacs client to Speech Dispatcher.

It consists of two parts:

- The library file speechd.el implementing access functions to the Speech
  Dispatcher protocol.

- The file speechd-speak.el that makes Emacs speak.

Prerequisites:

- The Elib Elisp library is required (available in Debian as `elib').

Installation:

- Copy the *.el files somewhere to your Emacs load path.

- If you like, byte compile them.

- Start speechd.

- Start Emacs and apply the commands

   M-x load-library RET speechd-speak RET
   
   M-x speechd-speak RET

Now, your Emacs should start speaking.

You can send your bug reports, patches, suggestions, etc. to the mailing list
speechd-devel@freebsoft.org.
