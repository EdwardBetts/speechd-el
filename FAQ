Q: When I scroll the text down with C-n in a buffer rapidly, the cursor doesn't
   move through each line, but "freezes" instead sometimes.

A: Your computer is too slow to handle all the Emacs actions.  Delayed
   redisplay is an inherent property of Emacs when it is busy.  All you can do
   (except buying a faster computer) is to slow down your autorepeat rate.
   Standard Emacspeak doesn't suffer of this problem, since its communication
   with the servers is unidirectional only.
