User-visible changes to speechd-el:

* Changes in speechd-el 1.0

** The top customization group is called speechd-el now.


* Changes in speechd-el 0.5

** Messages from built-in functions can be read now.

** New user option speechd-speak-message-time-interval.

It allows you to control speaking of repeated messages.

** Mode line can be read in CVS versions of Emacs.

See the command speechd-speak-read-mode-line bound to the `C-e RET' key.

** New commands providing basic information about current environment.

Type `C-e C-i C-h' to see the list of those commands.

** Some state changes can be automatically reported now.

See the variable speechd-speak-state-changes.

** The SPEECHD_HOST environment variable is honored now.

** Changes in communication with Speech Dispatcher.

Former socket based asynchronous communication with Speech Dispatcher was
unreliable and could cause errors in some situations.  This has been fixed for
CVS Emacs versions.  In Emacs 21.3, two alternative workarounds are available:
either one-way communication with Speech Dispatcher (the default) or using the
spdsend utility (if the speechd-spdsend variable is set).

** speechd-connection-parameters removed.

This obsolete variable is no longer available, use speechd-connection-voices
instead.


* Changes in speechd-el 0.4

** Whitespace signalization added.

It allows you, among others, to distinguish between empty lines and lines
containing only whitespace.

** Repetition of last speakings possible in character reading prompts.

For instance, it is possible to repeat Ispell choices in ispell-word now.

** Language selection based on currently selected input method is possible.

See the new variable speechd-speak-input-method-languages.

** Asynchronous action handling reworked.

The former mechanism of speaking in asynchronous actions, such as process
outputs or timers, was broken.  It should be fixed now.

** Responsiveness improved.

speechd-el is now much more responsive when speaking many small pieces of text.


* Changes in speechd-el 0.3

** Connection parameters are handled in a different way.

Connection parameters are configured as voices in the speechd-voices variable
now.  Each specific voice can then be assigned to a connection or face, see the
variables speechd-connection-voices and speechd-face-voices.  The variable
speechd-connection-parameters is obsoleted and shouldn't be used anymore.

** Bug reporting changes.

Bug reproduction finishing key was changed from `C-e C-z' to `C-e C-f'.
New command speechd-bug-reproduce allowing to reproduce a bug any time.
Log extraction speed up.

** Volume setting added.

You can use the `C-e d V' command with Speech Dispatcher 0.3 or higher to
adjust speech volume.

** The *Completion* buffer is spoken now.

** You can shut up speechd-el in debugger.

See the new variable speechd-speak-in-debugger.


* Changes in speechd-el 0.2

** read-event prompts are spoken now.

** Spelling support added.

You can now use speechd-speak-spell-mode to enable spelling in a buffer or the
`C-e C-l' keys to cause the next command to spell the text it reads.

** Choosing widget values improved.

The variable widget-menu-minibuffer-flag is now automatically set to t when
speechd-speak-mode is enabled, thus the widget value is chosen using usual
minibuffer completions.

** Bug reproduction finishing key was changed from `C-e .' to `C-e C-z'.
