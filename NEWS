User-visible changes to speechd-el:


* Changes in speechd-el 0.3

** Connection parameters are handled in a different way.

Connection parameters are configured as voices in the speechd-voices variable
now.  Each specific voice can then be assigned to a connection or face, see the
variables speechd-connection-voices and speechd-face-voices.  The variable
speechd-connection-parameters is obsoleted and shouldn't be used anymore.

** Bug reporting changes.

Bug reproduction finishing key was changed from `C-e C-z' to `C-e C-f'.
New command speechd-bug-reproduce allowing to reproduce a bug any time.
Log extraction speed up.

** Volume setting added.

You can use the `C-e d V' command with Speech Dispatcher 0.3 or higher to
adjust speech volume.

** The *Completion* buffer is spoken now.


* Changes in speechd-el 0.2

** read-event prompts are spoken now.

** Spelling support added.

You can now use speechd-speak-spell-mode to enable spelling in a buffer or the
`C-e C-l' keys to cause the next command to spell the text it reads.

** Choosing widget values improved.

The variable widget-menu-minibuffer-flag is now automatically set to t when
speechd-speak-mode is enabled, thus the widget value is chosen using usual
minibuffer completions.

** Bug reproduction finishing key was changed from `C-e .' to `C-e C-z'.
