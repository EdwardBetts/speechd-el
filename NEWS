User-visible changes to speechd-el:

* Changes in speechd-el 0.2

** read-event prompts are spoken now.

** Spelling support added.

You can now use speechd-speak-spell-mode to enable spelling in a buffer or the
`C-e C-l' keys to cause the next command to spell the text it reads.

** Choosing widget values improved.

The variable widget-menu-minibuffer-flag is now automatically set to t when
speechd-speak-mode is enabled, thus the widget value is chosen using usual
minibuffer completions.
